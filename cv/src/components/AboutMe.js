            <p>I started my programming journey at
                <a href="https://teknikhogskolan.se/utbildningar/net-utvecklare/"> Teknikh√∂gskolan</a> in
                august 2021. I have always had an interest for tech and how
                things are working, <i>how does this thing work like the
                    way it does?</i> I love new learnings and to challenge myself.
                When it comes to my work history I have always come to an end
                where I feel a little bit trapped, like I know how everything
                works here. Ofcourse there are always things to improve but there
                are no longer a challenge. Therefore, I think a career as a
                programmer is the way to go for me where everything is constantly
                moving forward.
